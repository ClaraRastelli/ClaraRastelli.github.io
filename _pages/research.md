My research lies at the intersection of physical oceanography, computational science, and mathematics. Current research projects include:
- Quantitative methods for ocean observing system design
- Dynamical proxy potential of the OSNAP array
- Remote drivers of Nordic Seas heat anomalies and climate predictability
- Ice-ocean interactions
- Constraints of proxy data on past ocean circulation


## Quantitative methods for ocean observing system design

Observing systems are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore often rely on short-term funding. 
A central focus of my research is the development of quantitative and dynamics-based methods that support the design of long-term effective observing systems. I am interested in questions such as:
- What dynamical information is contained in already existing observation networks? 
- What is the optimal instrument configuration, which is both cost-efficient and capable to monitor key processes and ocean variability?

I am currently exploring an approach that uses uncertainty quantification and adjoint models within ocean state estimation.

## Dynamical proxy potential of the OSNAP array

  <figcaption> What information do the OSNAP observations (black) provide for remote regions such as (i) subsurface temperature at the East Greenland margin (purple) and (ii) heat content of the Norwegian Sea (green)? </figcaption>
</figure>

The first data from the OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) array, a recently installed observing system in the subpolar North Atlantic, has provided new insights into volume, heat, and freshwater transports at the latitudes of the array. A next step is to put the OSNAP observations into a broader spatial and temporal context. I am interested in the following question:
- Can the OSNAP array inform - or could even serve as a _proxy_ for - unobserved hydrographic and circulation quantities remote from the array?

I'm quantifying the proxy potential of the OSNAP array by means of a novel, dynamics-based technique that uses adjoint modeling and uncertainty quantification within the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) state estimation framework.
The novelty consists of two aspects:
- OSNAP's proxy potential is evaluated based purely on dynamical information that is propagated via the equations of motion, as opposed to techniques that are based on statistical inference, e.g., correlations, regression and EOFs.
- No actual OSNAP measurement values are needed such that OSNAP's proxy potential can be investigated on longer timescales than the 21 months of OSNAP data that are currently available.

## Remote drivers of Nordic Seas heat anomalies and climate predictability

</figure>

Variability in the poleward progression of ocean heat across the Nordic Seas - from the subpolar North Atlantic towards the Arctic Ocean - is important for Arctic sea ice, melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and northwestern European climate. 
I'm trying to understand what drives anomalies in Nordic Seas heat content on seasonal to decadal timescales. 
I'm particularly interested in _where_ and _at what lead times_ such heat anomalies originate, because anomalies that originate remotely may contribute to decadal climate predictability.

To identify remote origins and drivers of climate predictability, I'm using the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) state estimate and adjoint-derived sensitivities.


## Ice-ocean interactions

The interaction of warm subpolar North Atlantic ocean waters with Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers is a dominant trigger for the glaciers' retreat and acceleration. Jakobshavn Isbræ and Helheim Glacier are two examples of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland that have gained much attention recently, as they have undergone rapid changes since the 1990s. I am exploring the sensitivity of subsurface temperature close to Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers, such as Jakobshavn Isbræ and Helheim Glacier, to climate signals in the far-field.


## Constraints of proxy data on past ocean circulation

</figure>

Paleoclimate archives provide information on the evolution of past climates and can improve our understanding of the processes that underlie low-frequency variability in the climate system. 
However, paleoceanographic data types and coverage are (and always will be) very limited, and proxy data entails large uncertainties. 
For paleoclimate reconstructions, model-data synthesis is promising since it permits using dynamical principles to constrain interpretations of proxy observations and to compute unobservable climate aspects.
I'm interested in quantifying the capability of the available proxy data to dynamically constrain ocean circulation of the past, taking into account its sparsity and uncertainties.
