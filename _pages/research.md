My research lies at intersection of physical oceanography, computational science, and mathematics. Current research projects include:
- Quantitative methods for ocean observing system design
- Dynamical proxy potential of the OSNAP observations
- Remote drivers of Nordic Seas heat anomalies


## Quantitative Methods for Ocean Observing System Design

Observing systems are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore often rely on short-term funding. 
A central focus of my research is the development of quantitative methods that support the design of long-term effective observing systems. I am interested in questions like:
- Which information is contained in already existing observation networks? 
- What do such existing networks tell us about ocean circulation in remote regions away from the instruments? 
I am currently exploring an approach that uses uncertainty quantification and adjoints within ocean state estimation.

Variability in the poleward progression of ocean heat across the Nordic Seas, from the subpolar North Atlantic towards the Arctic Ocean, has been linked to Arctic sea ice extent, mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, and northwestern European climate. It is not well understood, However, remotely triggered perturbations are usually not further disentangled according to their forcings and regions of origin. 
I compute adjoint sensitivities of Nordic Seas heat content to local and remote atmospheric forcing within the ECCOv4 ocean state estimation framework.

The aim of this chapter is therefore to disentangle local and remote processes that generate upper-ocean heat content anomalies in the Nordic Seas on timescales up to a decade, and identify how atmospheric forcing anomalies in remote regions can generate upper-ocean heat content anomalies in the Nordic Seas. 
However, remotely triggered perturbations are usually not further disentangled according to their forcings and regions of origin. This is partly due to the fact that the employed technique of using correlations does not allow identification of physical causation, only mutual variability. In contrast, adjoint-based sensitivity studies reveal causal chains and dynamical relation- ships among physical variables encoded in the model, and shall be the approach of this work. -->

## Connecting the OSNAP observations to remote regions 
The first data from the OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) array, a recently installed observing system in the subpolar North Atlantic, has provided new insights into volume, heat, and freshwater transports at the latitudes of the array. An important next step is to put the OSNAP observations into a broader spatial and temporal context, answering the key question: Can the OSNAP array inform - or could even serve as a proxy for - unobserved hydrographic and circulation quantities remote from the array? For instance: For Nordic Seas heat content or subsurface temperature close to Greenland's margins?

I quantify the proxy potential of the OSNAP array by means of a novel, dynamics-based technique that uses adjoint modeling and uncertainty quantification within the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) state estimation framework.
The novelty consists of two aspects. First, OSNAP's proxy potential is evaluated based purely on dynamical information that is propagated via the equations of motion, as opposed to techniques that are based on statistical inference, e.g., correlations, regression and EOFs. Second, no actual OSNAP measurement values are needed such that OSNAP's proxy potential can be investigated on longer timescales than the 21 months of OSNAP data that are currently available.

Observing systems, such as the OSNAP array and other observational efforts in the Atlantic, are expensive to deploy and maintain, and therefore often rely on short-term funding periods. Our novel method can be used to support the design of an effective, long-term Atlantic observing system, owing to the following features: the method is fundamentally dynamics-based, takes into account data redundancy between observations, and can evaluate not only existing, but also future and hypothetical observing systems.
