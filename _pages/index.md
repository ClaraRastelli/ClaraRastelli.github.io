# About


I am a postdoc at the University of Colorado Boulder and member of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team (CPT)](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). My research focuses on the energy cycle of the ocean mesoscale eddy field -- its generation, its interaction with the large-scale flow, and its dissipation. With a better understanding of the ocean eddy energy cycle, I am hoping to improve the representation of mesoscale processes in ocean models.
I am also engaged in developing [open-source software tools](https://github.com/ocean-eddy-cpt/gcm-filters) to enable our Earth Science community to perform data analysis in an efficient way.

Before joining the CPT, I worked on adjoint modeling and ocean state estimation within the [ECCO project](https://ecco-group.org/), with a research focus on the subpolar North Atlantic, the Nordic Seas, and the Arctic Ocean.
I applied techniques from the computational sciences in order to quantify uncertainties in ocean state estimates and gain new insights into how to improve the global ocean observing system.

I completed my PhD in physical oceanography at the University of Bergen, Norway, and have a master's in math.


When I'm not doing research, I like being active in the outdoors. I love rock climbing, trail running, and backcountry skiing.
