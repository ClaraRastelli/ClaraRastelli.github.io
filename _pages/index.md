# About

I am a postdoc at the University of Colorado Boulder and member of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team (CPT)](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). My research focuses on the energy cycle of the ocean mesoscale eddy field -- its generation, its interaction with the large-scale flow, and its dissipation. With a better understanding of the ocean eddy energy cycle, I am hoping to improve the representation of mesoscale processes in ocean models.

Before joining the CPT, I worked on adjoint modeling and ocean state estimation within the [ECCO project](https://ecco-group.org/), with a research focus on the subpolar North Atlantic, the Nordic Seas, and the Arctic Ocean.
I applied techniques from the computational sciences in order to quantify uncertainties in ocean state estimates and gain new insights into how to improve the global ocean observing system. 

I am also engaged in developing [open-source Python tools](https://gcm-filters.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable our Earth Science community to perform data analysis in an efficient way. 
I am a PI in the [DJ4Earth project](https://dj4earth.github.io/), where we develop and use an open-source framework for universal differentiable programming in Julia, which integrates Bayesian inverse methods with scientific machine learning in Earth system models.

When I'm not doing research, I like being active in the outdoors. I love rock climbing, trail running, and backcountry skiing.
